## Documentation

This mobile app was developed from scratch using Flutter. Firebase Authentication is used for user sign-up and login.

For storing user data, such as user IDs and their respective reminders, MongoDB is utilized. Integration with MongoDB is achieved using Python's pymongo library.

Python's Flask library is used to set up the API, which connects seamlessly with the frontend Flutter environment.

## Note
Duely is currently under review for release on the Google Play Store.
